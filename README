This is a networking software platform written in Python, used for SINE.
This software is based on POX.

You can use this controller to control with SINE router, with the command below:
1)cd ~/sine_controller
2})./pox.py --verbose

POX officially requires Python 2.7 (though much of it will work fine
fine with Python 2.6), and should run under Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.
(And just about anywhere else -- we've run it on Android phones,
under FreeBSD, Haiku, and elsewhere.  All you need is Python!)
You can place a pypy distribution alongside pox.py (in a directory
named "pypy"), and POX will run with pypy (this can be a significant
performance boost!).
